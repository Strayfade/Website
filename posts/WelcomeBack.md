As you may have noticed, I decided to rewrite [strayfade.com](https://strayfade.com) to focus more on the design and aesthetic aspect of the website.

### Improvements
 - Most of the site is Markdown-based, including this page.
 - The site no longer requires Javascript running in the browser, which the old site heavily depended on.
 - All pages are completely dynamic, generated at runtime, and there are no HTML files on the server.
 - There are no image elements on the page. Everything is extremely scalable and all icons use [vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics)
 - The site scales to mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop, TV (you get the point).
